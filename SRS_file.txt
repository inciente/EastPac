--------------------------------------- Software requirement specification for EastPac repository
--------------- intercomparison module

Introduction: 
Purpose - to distribute and manage operations across multiple realizations of a model, and deliver results from those operations in a legible and easy-to-access manner.
Intended audience - people working with model output that have to handle dozens of folders with hundreds/thousands of files each, and perform same operations again and again across those files. 
Intended use - for now, use with Eastern Pacific simulations of CESM. The workflow starts with specifying model configurations, indicating their respective directories to load data, and then running operations on that data. 
Product scope - the ultimate goal is to provide a shell or interface that holds access to all different models, rather than to bake in specific commands or analysis tools (see other modules for that).
Definitions and acronyms - 

Overall description: 
User needs - to easily access datafiles from a given model run without having to individually look through all the folders and without repetitively typing filepaths into notebook.

Assumptions and dependencies - assume that all model files are netcdf and can be loaded onto xarray. Also, assume that each model run/config is stored in its individual folder and that its files have some sort of serialized naming convention. 
Will also need pandas, re(gex), xarray, os, and other modules.
